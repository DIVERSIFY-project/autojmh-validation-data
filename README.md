# AutoJMH Validation
You have arrived to the AutoJMH validation repo. In this document you fill find instructions to reproduce our results.

##Experiment 1
The experiment 1 consisted in a comparison between the microbenchmarks generated by AutoJMH, an expert and those of 6 Java engineers.

In order to reproduce this experiment:

1. Download and Maven-Install **AutoJMH** from its [sources](https://github.com/autojmh/autojmh-source-code)
2. Clone this repo to your machine, it contains the source code used by both AutoJMH and the participants to generate their microbenchmarks.
3. Locate the property file for `AutoJMHBase.properties` in the *src/main/resources* folder of the **AutoJMH** sources.
4. Set variable `projectDir` to the absolute path of the root *Samples* directory in your machine. (The root directory is the one containing the *pom.xml* file). 
   Set an output directory in `outputDir`, as well as a temporary working directory in `workingDir`. The working dir is for **AutoJMH** to store intermiediary results.
5. Execute AutoJMH using as entry point `fr.inria.autojmh.tool.AllTags.java`
6. The resulting microbenchmarks will be in your output directory

The microbenchmarks by the expert are located in dir "expert" and for the engineers 1 to 6 in the directories "eng1" to "eng6". 
The estructure is the same for all engineers and the expert.

1. Microbenchmarks MB1a and MB1b for the different behaviors of SUA 1 are located in class `DifferentInheritors.java`
2. Microbenchmark M2 for SUA 2 in class `TransientStateListAdd.java`
3. Microbenchmark M3 for SUA 3 in class `TransientStateListSort.java`
4. Microbenchmarks M4 and M5 for SUA 4 and 5 are located in class `MathOperations.java`

##Experiment 2
The experiment 2 was meant to evaluate the reach of AutoJMH in 5 real live projects. 

In order to reproduce this experiment:

1. You may find the code for all five projects in the *projects* directory of this repo. Uncompress them. 
2. Locate the property file for `AutoJMHBase.properties` in the *src/main/resources* folder of the **AutoJMH** sources.
3. Set variable `projectDir` to the root directory in your machine for the project you want to generate microbenchmarks.
(The root directory is the one containing the *pom.xml* file). Set an output directory in `outputDir`, as well as a temporary working directory in `workingDir`. The working dir is for **AutoJMH** to store intermiediary results.
4. Execute AutoJMH using as entry point `fr.inria.autojmh.tool.AllLops`
5. AutoJMH will print at the end of the process the results.
6. You may find the generated project in the `outputDir`.
